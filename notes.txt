NOTES FOR THE LECTION

pwd - print working directory => get the full path

ls - list all files and directories /without hidden ones/ 
if we want to get the hidden files too we can use => ls -a
if we want to get more details like size etc. use ls -l
-la to combo that

clear => clear the mess that you made

cd => change directorvy // example => cd ~/Documents/Projects/etc...
combine cd with .. to go back into the parent directory
cd ~ will get us back to the home directory

mkdir => creates a directory/folder // example => mkdir nqkvaPapka
mkdir .nqkvaPapka will create hidden folder

man nqkoq-komanda will give us a manual page that explains the command
and how to use it

cat somefile => printing the text content of a file directly in the terminal
normally we use that if we are not planing to edit
just to read a specific file's content

touch somefilename => that command creates a file // example => touch main.js 
touch .main.js => hidden file

nano => one of the easiest cli text editor to use // you can edit code/text files
directly in the terminal with nano // 
example => nano main.js

cp => copies a file to a given location needs the file name and the location as 
parameters

mv => works kinda like cut/paste in windows, moves the file to a specific location
we can use it to also simply rename the file

rm => removes a file, there is not recycle bin in the terminal so be careful when 
deleting

rm -r => removes whatever you give it as a parameter, normally used for folders
since it deletes recursively

whereis programName => gives us the path to the program that we are searching for
basically this is a question like "Where is firefox installed on that pc?"
retrieves man pages and libraries also
empty if no result is found

echo => just prints a string // example => echo "sudjuk" => sudjuk 

redirection - we can use redirection to basically send some information to a file
example => 

echo "sudjuk" > main.js // prepends the line
echo "sudjuk" >> main.js // appends the line
 
that is going to input sudjuk inside of the js file
we can write code directly from our terminal
use it whenever it makes sense

grep => searches for a line/text inside a file //
example:
grep "sudjuk" main.js => returns the line that includes the string
grep -v "sudjuk" main.js => returns all the lines that DONT include the string

wget => downloads the content of a file on the web //
example: wget https://www.zamunda.net => get that html/pdf file
